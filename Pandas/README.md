# Assignment Background - Pandas, Pandas, Pandas

The main premisce of this project focused on using Pandas dataframes to analyze player and item data from a data source.

After analyzing the data, I came across the following results:

----

## Players

We have a total of 576 unique players playing our game! Across the 179 items that these players have bought, we have amassed a profit of \$2379.77 from their various purchases. I will dive deeper into these results below.

### Player Gender

Our current gender split has Male users leading at 84.03\%, Females at 14.06\%, and 1.91\% with undisclosed genders. Male users lead the pack in spending as well, spending a total of \$1967.64, though Female and Undisclosed users spend approximately 10\% more on average than Male users. 

### Player Age

Most of our players fall within the 20 to 24 y/o age range, accounting for 44.79\%, with the next highest groups being the 15 to 19 y/o and 25 to 29 y/o age ranges. Ideally, we should target this chunk together and market our product more to the 15 to 29 y/o age range as a whole if possible. As for spending, the 20-24 y/o age range spent a combined \\$1114.06 on over 300 in-game items, followed by the aforementioned 15-19 y/o and 25-29 y/o groups respectively. 

### Key Players

I also pulled results about some of our top spenders. Our current highest spender is **Lisosia93**. He has spent \\$18.96 on 5 different items. He's followed by **Idastidru52** (\\$15.45) and **Chamjask73** (\\$13.83).

## Items

On the topic of items, I decided to do a dive into the items that our users have been purchasing to see what's popular among our players. Currently, our **Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm**	has net us \\$50.76 as our most popular and profitable item, followed by the **Fiery Glass Crusader** with a profit of \\$41.22 and **Extraction, Quickblade Of Trembling Hands** with a profit of \\$31.77.
