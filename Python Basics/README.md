# Assignment Background:

Using an included dataset [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv) my task was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* Print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

  ```text
